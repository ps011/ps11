We had out breakfast at the camps and then we left at around 11:00. 
We got the bikes checked and reached Diskit Monastry at around 12:00
We stayed at the Monastry for about an hour, enjoyed the enormous statue and clicked a lot of pictures.
We tried meditation as well for some time there üòÇ. I and Yash failed miserably at it. So we decided to
come out and enjoy the views. Meanwhile we defined an all together different meaning of OM and that remains between both of us.
We then started our journey for the rest of the day

Diskit - Shyok - Durbuk - Pangong Lake

Departure - 13:00
Arrival - 18:00

We started for Pangong through the Adam-Shyok route. People said that not many of the riders use that
but we decided to go on that because we were short of time the it was the shorter one.
Eventually, we got to know that the road runs on a river bed and is severly damaged at some points
On our way to Pangong, we clicked a lot of pictures, crossed some very bad roads and water crossings.
We stopped by Durbuk to have lunch and we got our bikes refueled there. There's no fuel station there,
but the locals sell petrol in bottles.
After the lunch, we headed towards Pangong, and after riding for almost 3-3.5 hours, we reached the world famous Pangong Lake.
We straight away searched for camps and the task was given to Me and Nakul. We finally got one and we stayed there.
That night, we had a bon fire and star gazing. We met a group of 3 Punjabis who were ready to accompany us on our trip till Leh.
We tried a lot to capture the Milky Way but we were only able to witness it as our
cameras were not that good. We slept at around 2:00.

---------------------------------------------------------

### Day 8

Pangong - Durbuk - Changla Pass

Departure - 11:00
Arrival - 14:00

As we slept late last night, it was obvious that we woke we late next day.
We woke up at around 8.30-9:00 because it was damn too cold.
We slept with 3-4 layers on ourselves then too we felt cold.
We got ready and left for the Pangong lake sight seeing.
It was a 2-3 KM ride from the tents and was by the lake side.
We captured a lot of pictures and the lake was very beautiful.
The water was turquoise. I saw this kind of a water body for the first time in my life.
We spent almost an hour there.
We also tried some archery and captured some pictures on a Yak as well.
After that we left the tents and there we loaded all our bags on the bike and started our journey for the rest of 
the day. This time, with 3 more companions.

When started, we suspected that the journey today is going to be tough as we'll encounter Changla Pass and that thing proved right.
Everyone was wearing 3-4 layers of clothes.
We crossed Durbuk without any difficulty and then the test of our and our bikes started.
An interesting incident also happened while riding from Durbuk to Changla. 
We had borrowed an air pump from a Guy at Kargil War memorial and we promised him to return that in Leh
But we were not able to find him there so we decided to keep the pump with us.
We coincidentally met that Guy on Pangong Lake, but then too we were not able to return that pump bcz our bags and all the luggage was kept in our tents
We promised him to return the Pump as soon as we reach our tent. But we forgot there as well.

But while we were riding from Durbuk to Changla, we saw a car with very low tyre pressure ahead us.
I was sitting behind Nakul and I told him to see the tyres of the car ahead us.
After a while, the car stopped and some guys came out of it to see the tyres and Wooaahhhhh....He was the same
guy who lent us the air pump. What a location and time it was to return his pump.
He thanked us, we thanked him and we handed over the pump to him and continued our journey to Changla

After a while the ascend of Changla Pass started and it was very steep. We had a Royal Enfield 350 Classic
with two guys riding on it with two rucksacks. It was very difficult for us and the bike to climb that.
At times, I had to get down from the bike so that Nakul can manage to climb a specific patch.
And trust me, it's hard to walk even a hundred meters in mountains. There were a couple of instances where the bike slipped 
and went out of control, but Nakul managed it pretty wellüëèüèª.

Finally, we reached Changla Pass at around 14:00. We stayed there for some 15-20 mins, clicked some pictures 
and then left for Karu via Shakti.


Changla Pass - Shakti - Karu

Departure - 14:15
Arrival - 17:30

I and Nakul were riding on one bike and Avdhesh and Yash were on the other one. Unfortunately, we had the one 
which was constantly failing to deliverüò™. The tyre bursted when we were around 3-4 km away from a village named Shakti.
Our fellow riders were already riding ahead of us and were unknown about our situation. We were also unaware of 
what was going to happen to us in the coming couple of hours. The tyre bursted because we tried to be smart. 
We were descending from Changla Pass and the roads were having a lot of loops and hair pin bends so we decided 
the take a short cut and avoid all those. So, for that, we took an unpaved road which resulted in a puncture.

Now, I and Nakul were stranded on an empty road. We started dragging the bike towards the nearest village that was Shakti.
I told Nakul to slowly drag the bike till then I went ahead to search for some help or lift.

Luckily, I got a lift in a car who previously denied to give us a lift. He took me till Shakti village and dropped me.
Nakul also came after 5-10 mins. We stood there, had some water and then tried contacting Avdhesh and Yash.
Fortunately, we got network coverage and we called one the 3 Punjabi guys who joined us from Pangong.
They told us that they have reached Karu and will wait for us there only. We then waited for someone who can help us 
out of this situation. 

Finally, after some time, a guy and a girl with a pickup truck arrived. We asked him to help us and surprisingly, he was
carrying an electrical air pump with him in his van. We pumped air into the tyre and I boarded the pickup van while 
Nakul started to ride the bike till Karu. Karu was near about 4-5 km from there. I with both the bags, was in the 
pickup van. We stopped once again in between to repump the air into our bike.
And after that, finally we reached Karu at 17:30.

We had lunch over there and we enquired about the Leh-Manali highway there. As the situation was still suspicious about it's opening.
Meanwhile Avdhesh and Yash took the responsibility to get the bike repaired. 
It took a lot of effort for them as well because Karu was a small village and not everyone was skilled to 
dismantle a Royal Enfield's tyre.

As the situation on Leh-Manali highway was getting worse due to the continuous snowfall. We decided not to take and 
retrace the path which we followed to reach Leh from Pathankot via Srinagar.

We decided to stay in Leh that night.


Karu - Leh

Departure - 18:30
Arrival - 19:30

We left at around 18:30 from Karu. It was a 35-45 min ride from Karu to Leh. We saw another monastry in between.
The guys with us told that the song "Sanam Re" was shot in that monastry.
Finally, we reached Leh...Again!!. 
We searched for some hotels and we found a couple of them in the mid of the City. 
Since we had a lot of time, we decided to explore Leh, a bit more.
I and Yash left early in search of some souvenirs. Meanwhile Avdhesh and Nakul went for some shopping.
We met after an hour at a cafe. They had bought some nice Shawls, so I also went with Nakul to get a couple of them.
After that, we went to Mall Road to buy some souvenirs. We had our dinner at a restaurant nearby and returned to the Hotel.
After sometime, I got a text from Namrata saying that she's also in Leh and staying at a Backpackers Hostel.
This was the second time when we travelled to the same place.
I went on to meet her. I returned at around 23.30-00.00.
We planned for the next day to see the Leh Palace first and then leave towards Srinagar.

---------------------------------------------------------

### Day 9

Leh - Kargil - Zozila - Sonamarg

Departure - 10:00
Arrival - 23:30

We got up a bit late in the morning. 
Got ready quickly, loaded our bikes and left for the Leh Palace.
Leh Palace is an old building turned into an exhibition hall.
We reached there, explored that, clicked some photographs and spent around an hour there.
When we came back to our bikes.....an uninvited problem was waiting for us.
Someone parked their car just behind our bikes. We were literally not able to move our bikes.
We were blocked but also we were short of time. 
Then we took a brave stepüòÇ.

We held the car from the front side and lifted it and then we moved it aside, so that our bikes can be unblocked.

We then left Leh Palace and started our ride towards Srinagar.
There was a Hall of Fame in Leh. Which was an exhibition of Indian Army's operations in Ladakh region.
Initially, only I was in favour of going there and I insisted on it, so eventually everybody had to agree
and we went to the Hall of Fame. It took us an hour or so to roam in and around the Hall Of Fame.
So technically, we were up at 10 but it was 11:30 and we were still in Leh.

After a short and sweet visit to the Hall of Fame, we moved ahead and guess what, next stop was 20KM away.
Shri Patthar Sahib Gurudwara . We reached there at 12:00. We spent around an hour there. Had our lunch there only in the Langar.
Heard about the story of Patthar Sahib Gurudwara and left for the next stop. 
From there, we stopped by the Magnetic Hill and tried to understand the logic of it. But it seem quite evident that there was nothing like Magnetic field in that Hill.
I was excited to see this but was disappointed. It was just a slant road going down on which vehicles automatically move.

We stayed there for around 10 mins and then started our journey towards Kargil. When we left for Lamayuru, Nakul and Avdhesh took some lead and went ahead.
I and Yash were behind. Suddenly, the accelerator of our bike stopped working. I tried very hard by pulling the throttle 
but no luck. As it was a steep descend, we rode for around 3-4 km without and juice but then the road was flat.
I tried to alert the Guys ahead of us by ringing the emergency horn, but they were way too far and were't able to hear us.
I told Yash about the situation, and he said that let it roll till the end of descend, then well see what we can do.
The bike came to a stop, and the accelerator was still not working. We thought that the accelerator wire was broken.
The all of a sudden, Yash noticed that the engine is switched off ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. We started the engine, and the accelerator was working again üòÇ.
We moved and crossed Lamayuru. Roads were very curvy and there were a lot of hair pin bends there which tested our riding skills and patience.
That dat, I and Yash were riding together and Nakul and Avdhesh were on the other bike. This happened because Nakul and Yash 
did not want to ride on the same bikeüòÇ. We were riding ahead of the other bike. 



Then we reached Namik La Pass.
Which is the highest point on the Srinagar-Leh Highway. I and Yash stopped there and waited for Nakul and Avdhesh.
When they arrived, Avdhesh was laughing. When we asked him the reason, he told us about an incident happened to them a while ago. 

Nakul was riding the bike on the curves. Then came a sharp hairpin bend, the bike was at around 40-50 kmph.
Nakul turned the bike but wasn't able to turn it completely and the bike went off the track. Avdhesh immediately
told him to apply the front breaks to make to bike stop. On which, Nakul replied, "Can we use front breaks as well in this ????".
Then we came to know that Nakul did the whole trip without knowing that front breaks can be used. We all burst into laughter 
after hearing this.

After this small chit chat, we clicked some pictures there and left as it the wind speed was way too high there and we were short of time.
We had to cross the Zozila Pass as well. Which was 150km away from where we were standing.

We reached the Army Cafe, where our bike broke when we were riding to Leh from Kargil. We stopped by and had some snacks.
It was already 16:00 on the clock and we had to hurry if we wanted to cross the mighty Zozila Pass.

We quickly wrapped up the snacks and left for Kargil. I was riding the bike and the other one was ridden by Nakul.
I speeded up a bit to cover the time. We reached Kargil at around 17:30 and continued to ride. Reaching Dras took us another 
one and a half hour. It was 19:00 on the clock now and we still had to cross the Zozila Pass and reach Srinagar (according to our plan).
From Dras, it took us another hour to reach the checkpoint, from where Zozila Pass starts.
It was Dark and Cold. I and Yash then decided to stop on the checkpoint and wait for Nakul and Avdhesh as they
were behind us. In the meantime, we logged the entry of our bikes in the Army register and had some Tea.

Nakul and Avdhesh arrived after some 15-20 mins. We sat down at the tea stall to analyze the situation and
after a healthy discussion, we concluded that we'll cross the pass right now and will stick to the plan of reaching Srinagar on that day itself.

Avdhesh told me to stay behind them and not to ride too fast so that we can communicate in case of any emergency.
We started climbing the Mighty Zozila Pass. The roads were too bad, it was very cold and there were potholes and molten know
all around, making the ride even more difficult. 

While crossing the pass, rear breaks malfunctioned, I tried to stop the bike using rear breaks but I failed.
I then controlled the bike using the gears and the front breaks only. We still had to cover 6KM. I rode the bike
between 20-25kmph for the remaining 6 KM. 

The coordination between us was outstanding that night. Not a single instance was there when we felt that we're losing sight of each other.

Finally, we crossed the Zozila Pass and after riding for another hour, we reached Sonamarg.

We were hungry AF. So we stopped by a North Indian restaurant for dinner. It was 23:00 on the clock.
We decided to stay in Sonamarg, as it wal almost midnight, we were tired and the breaks were also not properly working.
We unloaded the bikes and stayed in a hotel nearby.  

 


---------------------------------------------------------

### Day 10

Sonamarg - Srinagar - Udhampur -  Pathankot  


Departure - 9:30

And the 10th day of the Trip to Solace begun with the chirping of birds and shining snow. Sonamarg it was. 
We woke up early that day, at around 8:00 and got ready by 9:00. We loaded our bikes and left without having breakfast, 
after deciding to have it in some restaurant on our way.

While leaving, we didn't knew that this is going to be the longest, toughest and most adventurous day of our trip.


We decided to hit Amritsar by midnight as it was 527KM from Sonamarg and we left the place at 9:45.
We stopped after 20-30 KM to have breakfast on a Dhaba on the way to Srinagar.

We reached Srinagar by 14:00. Although it was only 80KM from Sonamarg, but the roads weren't that great.
Also, the bikes were now vulnerable to any kind of damage. The views were breathtaking and we were awestruck by them.
This was another factor that slowed us down.

When we reached Srinagar, we decided that we'll not waste much time here and leave ASAP. But we ended up spending 2.5 hours there.
First we went to the Mughal garden (suggested by someone on the way). It was HOTüî•. Temperature was touching 40C.
We roamed around in the garden and witnessed some pretty good flora there. Clicked a lot of pictures and embraced the beauty.
One funny thing that we noticed in that garden was, people were bathing in the fountains that were installed in the park to enhance the beauty of it.
We left the garden after 40 mins and headed straight to the market, as Nakul wanted to get some dry fruits.
We enquired about that and found out that Lal Chowk is the place. 
We had heard about that place earlier and also, we knew that it is going to be dangerous, still we went for that.
I and Yash were on a bike while Nakul and Avdhesh were riding the other one. On one turn, we misjudged Google Maps
and went straight instead of taking a left turn.....and then we were lost. We asked the local people about the directions
and the told us that we left Lal Chowk behind.

We retraced the route and reached Lal Chowk. Now the challenge was to find Nakul and Avdhesh as there was only 1 cell phone working between the 4 of us 
and that was with Nakul.

I and Yash stood on a side and we were discussing about where to go so that we can find the other two guys.
Suddenly, an old man came to us and said, are you with those two guys who just passed from here?
We said yes (but how did he guessed). By seeing the question mark on our faces, he told us that the same orange bags were mounted on that bike as well.
 That's why he was able to identify us. We thanked him and went ahead in search and NJ and AV.
 
 We found them on the other side of the road where Avdhesh was sitting on the bike and Nakul was on a shop.
 I parked my bike beside his and Yash went to the shop with Nakul. I and Avdhesh stood there and discussed about the rest of the plan.
 We knew that we were way too late and were running behind our target.
 He said that we might not reach Amritsar today if we go like this. Then both of us said together that, whatever happens, we'll reach
 Amritsar today, either by hook or by crook. He told me that we need to ride faster and should take less breaks.
 
 Finally the shopping ended and the space crisis began. They had bought dry fruits in kilos. There was no way we can
 accommodate those on our bags. 
 
 Somehow, Yash managed to keep his stuff inside his bag and Nakul decided to keep his stuff in his hands on the back seat of the bike.
 
 
 We started riding towards Udhampur now. Just when we were about to cross Srinagar City, a hilarious incident took place.
 
 On a busy road of Srinagar, the bag of walnuts in Nakul's hand, suddenly bursted and there were walnuts all around...üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
 
 On the road, footpath, beneath the carsüòÇüòÇ. We stopped our bike immediately on a side and started picking up those. 
 We collected the walnuts in whatever we got, be it a cap, helmet, handkerchief, hoodie and what not.
 
 After an effort of 10 minutes, we were able to recover almost 75-80% of walnuts.üòÇüòÇ 
 
 Then we quickly got on our bikes and started riding. It was 16.30 on the clock and we still had 434 KM to cover on that day, which ideally take
 10 hours in a Car. We rushed quickly towards the highway.
 
 We crossed, Avantipora, Pulwama, Tral, Pampore etc. We had heard these names in news only and now we were witnessing them on milestones.
 
 After riding for another 40KM, we stopped for a quick lunch. Had our lunch in 20 mins and left from there.
 
 We rode continuously for 120KM after that, crossed Jawahar tunnel in between then stopped for a Tea and Water break on a tea stall near a mountain.
 We spent around 15-20 mins there. Our thighs and legs were going numb at this point of time. 
 
 We started again after the rejuvenating tea break. It was 18:30 already and the sky was getting dark. 
 
 The next sprint lasted for another 80-90KM and we reached Udhampur. We were hungry and tired. 
 We turned the bikes inside Udhampur city in search of a restaurant. It was 20:30 on the clock. It was almost 12 hours since we left Sonamarg.
 Phone's batteries were almost dead, hands and legs were numb, faces were full of dirt, bikes were hot AF but still there was a Force inside all of us
 which pushed us to go above and beyond our comfort zone. We had our dinner in Udhampur and decided what to do next. Surprisingly, everyone wanted to
 go ahead and reach Amritsar that day only. We searched on Google Maps and asked the hotel staff about the shortest route to Pathankot. They told us 
 that there are a couple of options. We can either go to Pathankot via Jammu (the route which we took while going to Leh) or, we can take a shorter route
 which is not a highway and there's not much traffic there and is less preferred but he said that is is totally safe to take the shorter one.
 
 So we decided to take the shorter route, which will connect us directly to Pathankot and from there we can reach Amritsar which is onlt 115KM from there.
 Udhampur to Pathankot is a 127KM long route in which 60KM is not a highway but a damaged two lane road.
 
 We started at around 22:00 from Udhampur. Refueled our bikes at a fuel station there only and began our trail towards Amritsar.
 
 We rode for only 4-5 KM and Yash said that he's feeling very sleepy. At first, I told him to hold me tightly and keep his head on my shoulder
 so that he does not fall off the bike. It went well for a few kilometers but as and when Yash went into deep sleep (He can sleep anywhere)
 he started to disbalance the bike. I rang the emergency horn and but didn't stopped the bike. I yelled at Yash to wake up until we
 reach some safe place. Avdhesh and Nakul were very attentive and immediately responded to the emergency horn and slowed down their bike.
 I moved a bit fast to catch up with them and told them about the situation. Avdhesh also yelled at Yash for his irresponsible behaviour.
 Yash promised that he won't sleep now and we continued our ride without stopping. After a while, I began to feel sleepy but I didn't told
 this to anyone, not even Yash; as he was also controlling his sleep with difficulty. After a moment I felt  Yash's helmet clashed with mine,
 I shouted his name and he was like..."Haa bhai....jaag raha hu...nahi soya...". As I was also feeling sleepy, I thought to take a break
 and wash my face. I rang the emergency horn again, NJ and AV responded, I told them that Yash is feeling sleepy again, we must stop somewhere
 and have some Tea. After 4-5 KM we noticed a small Dhaba and a  welding shop. We stopped there to have Tea. I washed my face and Yash took a nap
 Avdhesh and Nakul took Tea. Yash promised that he won't sleep now.
 
 And we started again...
 
 Yash told me to keep talking to him so that he doesn't get bored and ultimately won't sleep. So I decided to tell him about
 some incidents happened to me in the past couple of years (Nothing can be more interesting than those and we still laugh when we remember that conversation).
 After riding for another hour, we hit the highway. It was 1:00 AM. 
 
 That highway kind of boosted our morale. There was a spark inside all of us. We stopped for a couple of minutes and then began our last sprint.
 
 Pathankot was 70KM and Amritsar was 175KM. It was 1:00 AM and we thought that we will reach Amritsar by 4:00 AM.
 
 Our bikes were cruising at 90-100kmph. we rode for 60 odd kilometers and then a dangerous incident happened.....
 
 Our bike's rear tyre bursted. The bike was on 90kmph. I was riding it. As soon as the tyre bursted, the bike went out of my control....
 
 
 Yash panicked, I panicked but then I quickly gathered myself and lowered the gears to slow down the bike, as pressing the front breaks was not an option
 and pressing the rear breaks would have crashed us immediately. Lowering the gears slowed down the bike to 50kmph, then I gently 
 applied rear and front breaks together (40:60 ratio. Thanks to Avdhesh for that 60-40 lesson). The bike came to a stop after 70-80 meters.
  Fortunately, there was no injury to either Me or Yash and the bike was also safe. We parked the bike on one side and waited for AV and NJ to arrive.
  It was 2:00AM. Our eyes were full of sleep. We could hardly see any population around us. There  were just two Dhabas and a fuel station and a mosque near us.
  
  
  Nakul and Avdhesh came and then we 4 sat down to see what happened to the tyre. It was a large nail in the rear one. It was now impossible to move the bike from there.
  So I and Nakul went for a night stay hunt towards the hotels nearby and we failed in it. When we came back, we decided to park the bike there only and go to the Dhaba on 
  the other side of the road and have some rest there. We decided that we'll get the puncture repaired in the morning and then leave for Amritsar.
  
  Pathankot was still 10KM away and we slept on tables, chair, bike and whatever we got there.
  
  We'll never forget that night. 
  We started at 9:30 in the morning from Sonamarg and stopped at 2:00AM at a place 10KM away from Pathankot.
  Riding for 17 hours that day taught us about our endurance, patience, coordination, fearless decision making,
  trust in each other and what not.
